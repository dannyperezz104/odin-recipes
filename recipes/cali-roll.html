        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the sushi rice - Cook 1 cup of sushi rice according to package instructions. Once cooked, 
                transfer to a bowl and mix in rice vinegar, sugar, and salt while the rice is still warm. Allow it to cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Prepare the fillings - Slice the cucumber and avocado into thin strips. If using imitation crab, separate the sticks or shred the crab meat.</li>
            <li>Set up your rolling station - Place a bamboo sushi mat on a clean surface and lay a sheet of nori shiny side down on the mat.</li>
            <li>Spread the rice - Wet your hands to prevent sticking, then grab a handful of sushi rice and evenly spread it over the nori, leaving about 1 inch of space at the top.</li>
            <li>Add the fillings - Lay a few pieces of imitation crab, cucumber, and avocado horizontally across the center of the rice.</li>
            <li>Roll the sushi - Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the nori away from you, tucking the filling as you go. Apply gentle pressure to create a tight roll. Continue rolling until you reach the bare edge of the nori.</li>
            <li>Seal the roll - Wet the bare edge of the nori with a little water to help seal the roll. Gently press the roll to secure it.</li>
            <li>Slice the roll - Use a sharp knife to slice the roll into 6-8 pieces, wiping the knife with a damp cloth between cuts to keep the edges clean.</li>
            <li>Arrange the California rolls on a plate, and serve with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi on the side, and enjoy your homeads California rolls!</li>
